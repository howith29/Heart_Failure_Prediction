# Heart Failure Prediction - Experiment Summary

## 1. Research Purpose
- Predict mortality risk in heart failure patients using clinical data.
- Develop machine learning models to enable early detection and management.
- Compare model performance across different balancing strategies (Train-only SMOTE vs Full SMOTE).
- Identify the most effective and generalizable predictive model.

## 2. Background

Heart failure (HF) is a condition where the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body's needs, leading to serious complications such as arrhythmias, organ failure, and sudden death.  
According to the Korean Heart Failure Fact Sheet 2022, the prevalence of HF in Korea increased from 0.77% in 2002 to 2.58% in 2020, with mortality rising from 3.0 to 15.6 per 100,000 people [1].  
As HF advances, multi-organ dysfunction may require heart and multi-organ transplantation. Early prediction is crucial for timely treatment, complication prevention, and healthcare cost reduction, highlighting the need for machine learning-based risk prediction models.
